# Fauna-ETH Exchange
This is a project for metacrafters which contains a frontend connected to a solidity contract, which in turn connects to metamask to act as an ethereum deposit and withdrawal system.

## Description
The "Fauna-ETH Exchange" is a Solidity-based smart contract designed to illustrate how to connect a Solidity program with a frontend and use MetaMask to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It operates as an deposit and withdrawal system, allowing users to deposit or withdraw Ethereum. The contract includes transaction functions, demonstrating how to integrate blockchain functionality with web applications. This project serves as a foundational example for connecting these parts, offering a practical introduction to me for connecting smart contracts with frontend technologies and paving the way to create more advanced decentralized applications (dApps).

4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

**In the metamask wallet:**
1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.
